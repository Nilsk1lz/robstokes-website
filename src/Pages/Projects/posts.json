        "post": "In 2012 a company called BERG introduced a facinating little device called the Little Printer. It was a cute little printer that you could control with your phone and print off a variety of fun gimmicky things like sudoku, news headlines, weather reports etc.\nThe interesting thing was that this was basically just a POS receipt printer (thermal printer) that was repurposed and made into something cool and geeky.\nUnfortunately BERG went under a couple of years later and the cloud service that powered the device went with it. People were then left with useless little printers that didn’t do anything.\nI really wanted one at the time, but $259 for something that I knew was a $50 piece of hardware (at most) seemed crazy, even for me.\nFast forward…\nI’m writing this blog post mainly as a way of documenting my steps to producing something comparable to the Little Printer. My hope is that I can produce some software that can be used to power some potentially modified software so that I can bring the Tiny Printer to the masses. \nI thought it might be interesting to write down the iterations and ideas that I have along the way, and to share the stumbling blocks and possible solutions as I go, in case anyone wants to help out with this project, or is just interested in the process.\nWish me luck!"
